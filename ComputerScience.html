        <p>Computer science is the study of computation, algorithms, data structures, and the principles underlying the
          design and function of computers. It encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects of computing,
          including the development of software and hardware systems, programming languages, algorithms for solving
          problems, and the analysis of complex systems.</p> <!-- Paragraph defining computer science -->

      <p>
        Most positions in the field of computer science require a four-year university degree, providing a solid
        foundation in key principles like algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and computer
        architecture.<br><br> Universities offer comprehensive computer science programs that cover both theoretical
        concepts and practical application through projects, internships, co-op programs, and laboratory work. These
        hands-on experiences allow students to apply classroom knowledge to real-world situations, building skills and a
        portfolio that can impress potential employers. <br><br>Additionally, the professional connections made through
        internships and co-op programs can often lead to job offers or other career opportunities upon
        graduation.<br><br>
        However, note that a degree is not always necessary to land a job in computer science. Many successful
        programmers
        and developers have pursued non-traditional education paths, such as coding bootcamps, self-study, or online
        courses, to build their skills and gain employment in the tech industry. Employers often value hands-on
        experience, demonstrated skills, and a strong portfolio just as much as formal education.

      <p>Experience is a critical factor in landing a job in computer science. While formal education provides the
        theoretical framework, hands-on experience showcases your ability to turn knowledge into tangible outcomes.
        Employers in this field seek candidates who possess practical skills and have familiarity with multiple
        programming languages. They expect proficiency in various data structures and algorithms, as well as strong
        problem-solving capabilities. <br><br> In contrast to some other professions, gaining programming experience
        doesn't always require employment at a company. Although getting internships can help get you hired, many
        aspiring computer scientists build personal projects, solve practice interview questions online, and enroll in
        online courses to strengthen their skills. In fact, it is entirely possible to get a job in Computer Science. As
        long as you are able to demonstrate competent skills and experience. You can get hired! <br><br>Clicking on any
        of the icons on the right will direct you to

  <div class="job-info row"> <!-- Container for the featured career content -->
    <p> Full stack developers play a multifaceted role, with responsibilities spanning across the development
      lifecycle.
      They write, modify, integrate, and test code for both front-end and back-end components, ensuring that websites
      and web applications are robust, efficient, and user-friendly. This process requires expertise in a range of
      programming languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and backend technologies like Node.js or
      Python. A significant part of their work involves integrating various systems and ensuring that data flows
      seamlessly between the client-side and server-side.<br><br>In addition to core development tasks, full stack
      developers are responsible for conducting tests and analyzing data to monitor the quality, security, and user
      interface of their projects. This includes performing automated and manual tests to identify bugs, security
      vulnerabilities, and areas for performance optimization. They then use this information to implement
      improvements,
      ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. Developers may also work on implementing procedures for ongoing
      website revisions, allowing for flexibility and adaptability as technology and user expectations evolve.
